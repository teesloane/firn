* Details
** Quickstart
1. Download the [[https://github.com/theiceshelf/firn/releases][latest release]] (only Mac and Linux currently supported)
2. Move the Firn binary into your path: =mv ~/Downloads/firn /usr/local/bin=
3. Navigate to your directory of org files
4. Run =firn new=
5. Run =firn serve=
6. Run =firn build= when ready to put your site online!

** Overview

Firn is a static site generator that aims to be a drop-in solution for creating
web-sites from existing directories of org-mode files. Firn is a little
different than some static site generators in that it is exclusively for
rendering org-mode content; it is tailored to convert org-files into data
structures, from which data and meta-data can be collected when processing a
file.

When you create and build a Firn site, the following happens:

- Org files are read from a directory and parsed into a data structure
  (internally called /the org-tree/).
- Functions collect data (logbook entries, links, headlines) from the org-tree
  across individual and collective files.
- A user creates a "layout" file, using Hiccup and Clojure functions to render
  the collected data:
  - The entire file can simply be rendered to HTML.
  - Specific headlines, their content, or org-data can be processed in a [[file:layout.org][layout]]
    through the available ~render~ function.
  - The org-tree and as a data-structure is also available to layouts if a user
    need more fine-grained control.

** FAQ

*** Will Windows be supported?

Unknown. GraalVM is capable of compiling to [[https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/][native images]] for Windows. It may be
possible to compile it but the core developer is only capable of supporting Mac
and Linux at this time.

*** Where can I see the feature roadmap?

Keep an eye on the Github repository's [[https://github.com/theiceshelf/firn/issues][issues]] and [[https://github.com/theiceshelf/firn/projects/1][projects board]].
*** Do I have to use Clojure in my layouts?
For now, yes.
*** How can I easily learn about E-macs and Org-mode?

An opinionated response: try [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]], including [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCMh7srOqvw&list=PLhXZp00uXBk4np17N39WvB80zgxlZfVwj][Zaiste's tutorials]] (which
also cover org-mode).
*** At what point, if I chew gum enough, will it go from having flavour, to having no flavour to having flavour again?

That's a puzzler. I'm going to have to think about it.
