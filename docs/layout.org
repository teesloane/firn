* Overview

When you create a new Firn site for the first time, it will create a folder:
=_firn/layouts=. The layout folder stores Clojure files (=.clj=) that are
responsible for how your org-file is rendered to-html; The act of "applying" a
template means to pass the content of the org-file through a specific [[https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup][clojure
hiccup]] template that organizes how the content is displayed.

When an org-mode file is processed by Firn it looks for the in-buffer-setting
~#+FIRN_LAYOUT:~ to see if it uses a Layout. If none are specified, the _default
template_ is used.

* Usage

Let's walk through an example of how to use layouts.

Create a sample org file; we will call it =foo.org=. Edit it to include the
following:

*NOTE*: Because the snippet below is org-mode code, you will need to remove the =\=
preceding the =*= Headlines.

#+BEGIN_SRC org

#+TITLE: Layout
#+DATE_CREATED: <2020-03-24 Tue>
#+DATE_UPDATED: <2020-03-24 14:20>
#+FILE_UNDER: docs
#+FIRN_LAYOUT: docs

\* My project

 This is my project.

\* Notes

 - [ ] Figure out how layouts work.
#+END_SRC

Now we have a file that is going to look for a layout called "docs" in the
layouts folder. Return to the terminal.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd layouts
touch docs.clj
#+END_SRC

Inside docs.clj place the following clojure code.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn project
  [{:keys [render title partials]}]
  (let [{:keys [head nav]} partials]
    (head
     [:body
      (nav)
      [:main
       [:article
        [:div (render "Notes")]]]]))) ;; Renders The notes section.
#+END_SRC

*NOTE:* Layouts can have multiple Clojure functions in them, however only the last
function of the file will be applied as the layout.

* Do I have to use layouts?

Not exactly. When you create a new Firn site, it will have a =default.clj= file in
the =layouts= directory. This provides a very basic out of the box formatting and
will render the entirety of your org mode file. If you want to add any kinds of
customization - even css, you'll need to work with layouts.

* How do I customize the styling of my layouts?

As with normal HTML, you'll need to add a =head= tag with a =link= that references
to a css file. It might make sense for you to create a partial for defining your
html =head= tag, allowing it to be shared across layouts:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn head
  [body]
  [:html
   [:head
    [:link {:rel "stylesheet" :href "/static/css/firn_base.css"}]]
   body])
#+END_SRC

* The Render function

Render is used to render content from your org file. It's an important one - if
you don't use it, you won't see any org-mode content.

Quite a bit of data and functions are made available in your layouts. The =render=
function you to decide what parts of your org-file you would like to display. Firn
makes some "pre-made" content available for rendering - logbook graphs, table of
contents, etc. It can render multiple kinds of content"

| Render type       | Paramaters      | Example                                                              |
|-------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Entire file       | keyword         | ~(render :file)~                                                       |
| Specific headline | string          | ~(render "Notes")~                                                     |
| Specific content  | string, keyword | ~(render "Notes" :content)~                                            |
| Table of contents | keyword, map    | ~(render :toc {:depth int :exclusive? bool :headline "Notes"})~        |
| Logbook Polyline  | keyword, map    | ~(render :logbook-polyline {:stroke "#45698A" :height 60 :width 365})~ |
|                   |                 |                                                                      |


** Render an entire file

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn default
  [{:keys [render partials]}]
  (let [{:keys [head]} partials]

    (head
     [:body
       [:div (render :file)]])))
#+END_SRC
** Rendering specific headlines and content

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn default
  [{:keys [render partials]}]
  (let [{:keys [head]} partials]
    (head
     [:body
       [:div (render "Notes")] ; render everything in "Notes" (including the heading "Notes")
       [:div (render "Notes")] ; render the content in "Notes", excluding the heading.
      ])))

#+END_SRC

** Render a Logbook SVG Polyline

Graphs all logbook entries for the current file in a polyline, generating a chart for each year.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn default
  [{:keys [render partials]}]
  (let [{:keys [head]} partials]
    (head
     [:body
       [:div (render :logbook-polyline {:stroke "#45698A" :height 60 :width 365})]])))
#+END_SRC

** Rendering a Table of Contents
When a file is processed, Firn collects *all* of it's headlines, whether you're
choosing to render the entire file, or just one headline.

There are several ways you can create table of contents in your files, from simple to more complex use cases.

1. Render a table of contents for an entire file.

  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (defn default
    [{:keys [render partials]}]
    (let [{:keys [head]} partials]

      (head
       [:body
         [:div (render :toc)]
         [:div (render :file)]])))
  #+END_SRC

2. Render a table of contents for everything within a specific headline.

  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (defn default
    [{:keys [render partials]}]
    (let [{:keys [head]} partials]
      (head
       [:body
         ;; only renders a table of contents for a single headline's children.
         ;; `:eclusive?` means we don't render "Notes"; just headlines that fall under it dflakdjflksadjf lksadjf lkasdjf lkasdjf .
         [:div (render :toc {:headline "Notes"
                             :depth 4
                             :exclusive? true})]
         [:div (render "Notes")]])))
  #+END_SRC

3. From within a file, you can set the keyword ~#+FIRN_TOC~ and pass it a map with
   the properties above to enable a table of contents specific to a single file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  #+FIRN_TOC: {:depth 4}
  #+END_SRC


* Data and Functions available to layouts

The following keys are made available in your layouts.

| Function/Data | Intent                                               | Data-type |
|---------------+------------------------------------------------------+-----------|
| config        | The site wide config.                                | map       |
| date-created  | The #+DATE_CREATED value of the file                 | string    |
| date-updated  | The #+DATE_UPDATED value of the file                 | string    |
| file          | The file as a data structure.                        | map       |
| file-links    | A list of links per file                             | list      |
| firn-under    | The #+FIRN_UNDER value of the file                   | string    |
| logbook       | A list of logbooks entries per file.                 | list      |
| logbook-total | The sum of all the logbook entries per file          | string    |
| meta          | A map of metadata per file (logbook, links, etc)     | map       |
| partials      | a list of invokable partials in your =partials= folder | list      |
| render        | Enables rendering parts or entirety of an org file.  | function  |
| site-links    | A list of all links across all documents             | vector    |
| site-logs     | A list of aLL logbook entries.                       | vector    |
| site-map      | A list of all files on the wiki                      | vector    |
| title         | The #+TITLE value of the file.                       | string    |

This may seem like a lot of information to make available to a layout template.
And that's because it is. But thanks to destructuring in Clojure, you can make
your templates only ask for what they need:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn project
  [{:keys [ render partials logbook] :as data}] ; < destructuring to make available only what you need.
  (let [{:keys [head nav]} partials]
    (head
     [:body
      (nav)
      [:main.main-container
       (page-header data)
       [:div.container
        (main-section render)
        (sidebar render logbook)]]])))
#+END_SRC

The above template only needs access to =render=, =partials= and the =logbook=. Then functions, such as =page-header= can simply take the data map and destructure what /it/ needs again:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn page-header
  [{:keys [title logbook-total date-updated date-created firn-under]}]
  (let [rndr (fn [i s]
               (when i [:span.flex.pr2
                        [:h4.italic.bold.pr1 s " "]
                        [:h4.italic.thin i]]))]
    [:div.page_meta
     [:h1.page_meta_title title]
     [:div.flex
      (rndr date-created "Published: ")
      (rndr date-updated "Last Updated: ")
      (rndr firn-under "File Under: ")
      (when-not (= logbook-total "0:00")
        (rndr logbook-total "Time Logged: "))]]))

#+END_SRC


* Styling Layouts

You can write css as you normally would by placing css files in the
=_firn/static/css= folder and then having =firn= move them into your =_site= folder
when run. Styling is applied through [[https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup#syntax][hiccup]].

There are some internal styles that are applied when org-mode text is
transformed into data. These styles are all prefaced with the keyword =firn_=, (ie
=firn_title-prirority= or =firn_title-keyword=).

The following are the css classes and their rerspective org-mode structure they
augment, as they come hard-coded into firn:

| Css class                       | Element                                     |
|---------------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| .firn_title-priority            | Title Priority (ex: [#A] / [#B] etc)        |
| .firn_title-priority__A         | Targets =[#A]=                                |
| .firn_title-priority__B         | Etc.                                        |
| .firn_title-priority__C         | Etc.                                        |
| .firn_title-keyword             | Targets all keywords =TODO/DONE= etc.         |
| .firn_title-keyword__TODO       | Targets =TODO=                                |
| .firn_title-keyword__DONE       | Targets =DONE=                                |
| .firn-headline-timestamp        | Headline Timestamps*                        |
| .firn-headline-cookie           | Targets headline todo-count (ex =[7/10]=)     |
| .firn-headline-section          | A "*" container and it's contents           |
| .firn-headline-section-${level} | Target specific headline+container by level |
| .firn-headline-${1-6}           | Target h1-h6                                |
