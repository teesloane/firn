*Purpose:* This document explains how to render org-mode files in their entirety
or select portions of a file. It also covers the folding of headlines and their respective
content.

*Prerequistes*: an understanding of [[file:the-render-function.org][The Render Function]] and how [[file:layout.org][layouts]] work.

* Usage

To render an entire org-mode file:

** Render an entire file

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn default
  [{:keys [render partials]}]
  (let [{:keys [head]} partials]
    (head)
    [:body
     [:div (render :file)]]))
#+END_SRC

** Rendering specific headlines and content

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn default
  [{:keys [render partials]}]
  (let [{:keys [head]} partials]
    (head)
    [:body
      [:div (render "Notes")] ; render everything in "Notes" (including the heading "Notes")
      [:div (render "Notes" {:exclude-headline? true})] ; render the content in "Notes", excluding the heading.
      ]))

#+END_SRC
** Exclude a headline

Similar to org-export, you can add the ~:noexport:~ tag to a headline. Doing so will exclude the headline and all its children from being rendered.
