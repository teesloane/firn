* Overview

When you create a new Firn site for the first time, it will create a folder in
=_firn/layouts=.

When an org-mode file is processed by Firn it looks at the file's =keywords= to
see if it uses a Layout. If none are specified, the _default template_ is used.

The act of "applying" a template means to pass the content of the org-file
through a specific clojure hiccup template that organizes how the content is displayed.

* Usage

Let's walk through an example.

#+BEGIN_SRC  sh
mkdir firn_example
cd firn_example; touch foo.org
#+END_SRC

Navigate to =foo.org= and open the file. Edit it to include the following:

*NOTE*: Because the snippet below is org-mode code, you will need to remove the =\=  preceding the =*= Headlines.

#+BEGIN_SRC org

#+TITLE: Layout
#+DATE_CREATED: <2020-03-24 Tue>
#+DATE_UPDATED: <2020-03-24 14:20>

\* Tasks

 - [ ] Figure out how layouts work.
#+END_SRC

Now we have a file that is going to look for a layout called "docs" in the
layouts folder. Return to the terminal

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd layouts
touch docs.clj
#+END_SRC

Inside docs.clj place the following clojure code.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn project
  [{:keys [render title partials]}]
  (let [{:keys [head nav]} partials]
    (head
     [:body
      (nav)
      [:main
       [:article
        [:div (render "Notes")]]]]))) ;; Renders The notes section.
#+END_SRC

* Do I have to use layouts?

Not really. If you don't have any .clj files in the =_firn/layouts/= directory,
Firn will default to using the internal default template. This provides a very
basic out of the box formatting and will render the entirety of your org mode file.

* How do I customize the styling of my layouts?

As with normal HTML, you'll need to add a =head= tag with a =link= and linking
to a css file. It'll probably be most likely to create a partial for your =<head></head>=
content that can then be shared across layouts:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn head
  [body]
  [:html
   [:head
    [:link {:rel "stylesheet" :href "/static/css/main.css"}]]
   body])
#+END_SRC

* How do I drill down into the content of a headline?

First, a =headline= refers to a bullet headline in org-mode (the kind that are
toggle-able with the =tab key)=. A =headline= can have =sub-headlines=, =drawers=
(properties, logbooks, etc) and general text content (tables, lists, prose, etc.)

Because a headline can contain so much data, the =render= function, made
available to your layouts, aims to make getting content out of a headline easier.

View the code block below to see the multiple ways of using the =render= function

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
;; In it's simplest form you can render a headline in it's entirety.
;; This will search through the headlines for a headline with that name specifically
;; and then render it to HTML.
[:div (render "My Headline")]]

;; Next, you can ask to just render the headline's title:
[:div (render "My Headline" :title)]] ; => "My Headline"

;; You can also ask to get the "raw" text, which will just return the
;; plain-text of the title -- you're just getting <string> rather than
;; a hiccup data structure; so you won't be getting an H1/H2/H3 etc.
[:div (render "My Tasks" :title-raw)]] ; => "My Tasks".

;; Render the contents of the headline - ie, everything but the title "My Tasks".
[:div (render "My Tasks" :content)]]
#+END_SRC

* How can I access data in my layouts?
** Overview
Currently, you can also access some site-wide meta-data in your layouts, as well as
file-specific meta-data. Example meta-data:

- All logbooks across all files.
- All links across all files (which might be ideal for say... setting up a link graph.)
- Here's a full list of data/functions you can use in your layouts.

** All Data/Function

| Function/Data | Intent                                                 | Data-type |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+-----------|
| config        | The site wide config.                                  | map       |
| file-links    | A list of links per file                               | list      |
| file          | The file as a data structure.                          | map       |
| logbook       | A list of logbooks entries per file.                   | list      |
| partials      | a list of invokable partials in your =partials= folder   | list      |
| render        | Enables rendering parts or entirety of an org file.    | function  |
| site-links    | A list of all links across all documents               | vector    |
| site-logs     | A list of ALL logbook entries.                         | vector    |
| site-map      | A list of all files on the wiki                        | vector    |
| title         | The org mode file.                                     | string    |
| meta          | A map of metadata about the file (logbook, links, etc) | map       |
| title         | The #+TITLE value of the file.                         | string    |
| firn-under    | The #+FIRN_UNDER value of the file                     | string    |
| date-updated  | The #+DATE_UPDATED value of the file                   | string    |
| date-created  | The #+DATE_CREATED value of the file                   | string    |
| logbook-total | The sum of all the logbook entries                     | string    |
| toc           | Table of contents                                      | vector    |

This may seem like a lot of information to make available to a layout template. And that's because it is. But thanks to destructuring in Clojure, you can make your templates only ask for what they need:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn project
  [{:keys [ render partials logbook] :as data}]
  (let [{:keys [head nav]} partials]
    (head
     [:body
      (nav)
      [:main.main-container
       (page-header data)
       [:div.container
        (main-section render)
        (sidebar render logbook)]]])))
#+END_SRC

The above template only needs access to =render=, =partials= and the =logbook=. Then functions, such as =page-header= can simply take the data map and destructure what /it/ needs again:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn page-header
  [{:keys [title logbook-total date-updated date-created firn-under]}]
  (let [rndr (fn [i s]
               (when i [:span.flex.pr2
                        [:h4.italic.bold.pr1 s " "]
                        [:h4.italic.thin i]]))]
    [:div.page_meta
     [:h1.page_meta_title title]
     [:div.flex
      (rndr date-created "Published: ")
      (rndr date-updated "Last Updated: ")
      (rndr firn-under "File Under: ")
      (when-not (= logbook-total "0:0")
        (rndr logbook-total "Time Logged: "))]]))

** The ~Render~ function.

Render is used to render content from your org file. It's an important one - if you don't use it, you won't see any org-mode content. It can render multiple kinds of content:

*Render an entire file:*

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn default
  [{:keys [render partials]}]
  (let [{:keys [head]} partials]

    (head
     [:body
       [:div (render :file)]])))
#+END_SRC

*Render a headline and it's contents*

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn default
  [{:keys [render partials]}]
  (let [{:keys [head]} partials]
    (head
     [:body
       [:div (render "Notes")]])))
#+END_SRC

*Render just a headline title*, or the raw title.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn default
  [{:keys [render partials]}]
  (let [{:keys [head]} partials]
    (head
     [:body
       ; render the headline title in "raw" plain text.
       [:div (render "Notes" :title-raw)]
       ; render the headline title in "rich" text (can be bold, have italic, etc.)
       [:div (render "Notes" :title)]])))
#+END_SRC

*Render a Logbook as a polyline SVG:*

Graphs all logbook entries for the current file in a polyline, generating a chart for each year.

[[file:data/polyline.png][Polyline example chart]]

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn default
  [{:keys [render partials]}]
  (let [{:keys [head]} partials]
    (head
     [:body
       [:div (render :logbook-polyline {:width 365})]])))
#+END_SRC

* Table of Contents
When a file is processed, Firn collects *all* of it's headlines, whether you're
choosing to render the entire file, or just one headline.

There are several ways you can create table of contents in your files, from simple to more complex use cases.

1. Render a table of contents for an entire file.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn default
  [{:keys [render partials]}]
  (let [{:keys [head]} partials]

    (head
     [:body
       [:div (render :toc)]
       [:div (render :file)]])))
#+END_SRC

2. Render a table of contents for everything within a specific headline.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn default
  [{:keys [render partials]}]
  (let [{:keys [head]} partials]
    (head
     [:body
       ;; only renders a table of contents for a single headline's children.
       ;; `:eclusive?` means we don't render "Notes"; just headlines that fall under it.
       [:div (render :toc {:headline "Notes"
                           :depth 4
                           :exclusive? true})]
       [:div (render "Notes")]])))
#+END_SRC


* Styling Layouts

You can write css as you normally would by placing css files in the =_firn/static/css=
folder and then having =firn=  move them into your =_site= folder when run.
Styling is applied through [[https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup#syntax][hiccup]].

There are some internal styles that are applied when org-mode text is
transformed into data. These styles are all prefaced with the keyword =firn_=,
(ie =firn_title-prirority= or =firn_title-keyword=).

The following are the css classes and their rerspective org-mode structure they
augment, as they come hard-coded into firn:

| Css class                       | Element                                     |
|---------------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| .firn_title-priority            | Title Priority (ex: [#A] / [#B] etc)        |
| .firn_title-priority__A         | Targets =[#A]=                                |
| .firn_title-priority__B         | Etc.                                        |
| .firn_title-priority__C         | Etc.                                        |
| .firn_title-keyword             | Targets all keywords =TODO/DONE= etc.         |
| .firn_title-keyword__TODO       | Targets =TODO=                                |
| .firn_title-keyword__DONE       | Targets =DONE=                                |
| .firn-headline-timestamp        | Headline Timestamps*                        |
| .firn-headline-cookie           | Targets headline todo-count (ex =[7/10]=)     |
| .firn_headline-section          | A "*" container and it's contents           |
| .firn_headline-section-${level} | Target specific headline+container by level |
| .firn-headline-${1-6}           | Target h1-h6                                |
