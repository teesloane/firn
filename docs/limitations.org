#+TITLE: Limitations

* Footnotes

Currently it seems that *in dev-mode* - ie. when in the repl and using the
pre-compiled rust parser, footnotes definitions that have children on the same
line are not parse-able:

=[fn:1] Content here < fails the parser.=

Whereas, if you add a newline and add the content below, it works.

So, far this seems to be fine using the final compiled Firn binary.
