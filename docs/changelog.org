** Feature: Folding
- headlines and their content can be folded on a site-wide, layout-wide, or file-specific basis.
** Breaking Changes
- when rendering a table of contents, the options map has renamed a key from "exclusive?" to "exclude-headline?". As such:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(render :toc {:headline "Headings" :depth 1 :exclude-headline? true}) ; is now valid
(render :toc {:headline "Headings" :depth 1 :exclusive? true}) ; no longer works.
#+END_SRC

* V.0.0.7
** Feature: Pages

- Creating a [[file:pages.org][page]] in ~_firn/pages/my_page.clj~ will similar to layouts, convert hiccup to html.
** Feature: Tags and Tag Page
- tags are now displaying in headlines.
- tags in headlines are links to a /tags page, anchored to the respective tag clicked.
- The "tags.clj" page is created out of the box with a new Firn site.
- The tags page lists all tags across all headlines in all files; each a link that jumps to the respective heading.
