*Purpose:* This document explains how to render *backlinks* in your Firn layouts.

*Prerequistes*: an understanding of [[file:the-render-function.org][The Render Function]] and how [[file:layout.org][layouts]] work.

* Overview

/Backlinks/ are used to display a list of links to the /current/ document you are reading.


A document has backlinks if an org-mode file links to another org-mode file using a "[[https://orgmode.org/manual/External-Links.html][file]]" link.

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(render :backlinks)
#+END_SRC

The above will render a list of backlinks. However, you may want to check first /if/ backlinks exist. The below code samples creates a backlinks section, with a bit of styling and a headline to indicate the section's intent:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(when-let [backlinks (render :backlinks)] ; if backlinks exist, store them in a let binding.
  [:div
   [:hr]
   [:div.backlinks
    [:h4 "Backlinks to this document:"]
    backlinks]])
#+END_SRC
