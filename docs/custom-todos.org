*Purpose:* This document details how to configure Firn to recognize different org todo types, similar to ~org-todo-keywords~.


* Overview

If you customize org-mode to use different "Todo types", you may wish Firn to also recognize these todos. When Firn parses your org mode content, if you customize your todo-keywords, it enables you to style your keywords.

(In future versions of Firn, we may also enable the collecting of all todo-types, which will enable access to a complete list of all todo-types across all files.)

* Usage

In your [[file:configuration.org][config.edn file]] you can set your custom todo types like so:

#+begin_src  clojure

{;...
 :todo-keywords     ["TODO" "START" "HOLD" "WAIT" "DONE"]
 ;...
#+end_src

Now, whenever Firn encounters a headline with one of these keywords, it will apply *two* css classes to it. For example, the headline below:

=* TASK Finish application=

Will have these two css classes applied to it:

=firn-headline-keyword firn-headline-keyword__TASK=

This way, /all/ todo types can be generically styled with the =firn-headline-keyword= and each individual keywords can be styled with =firn-headline-keyword__${keyword}=
