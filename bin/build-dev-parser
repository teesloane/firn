# this scrip create the dev parser, for when developing with a REPL. Firn
# processes org content using a development binary which is just a rust bin
# wrapping orgize functionality. This way, one doesn't have to compile the
# entire graalvm firn binary just to run tests.
#
# The output binary goes into clojure/resources as well as firn/bin, in the case
# that someone wants quick access to the binary.
#
# NOTE: this is not currently setup to cross compile.
# NOTE: This script should be called via firn/makefile command: `make dev-parser`
