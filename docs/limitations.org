* Development Server

The file watcher (reloading of files on change) is a bit slow.

* Attachments

- Currently, Firn copies the _entirety of this folder into your build output_. This means that if you have attachments which are private or simply unlinked to from org-files, they will be included in your build output.
- Org-attach links are not supported.

* Footnotes

This does not affect user's who are using the Firn binary - only those using the
repl within the repo.

Currently it seems that *in dev-mode* - ie. when in the repl and using the
pre-compiled rust parser, footnotes definitions that have children on the same
line are not parse-able:

=[fn:1] Content here < fails the parser.=

Whereas, if you add a newline and add the content below, it works.
So, far this seems to be fine using the final compiled Firn binary.
