  UGH. this is a mess of a function, and should be refactored. Basically:
  - Loop through the children that represent a title.
  - get the values out and trim them in case there is whitespace
  (between say, a cookie or a priority, or empty text)
  - Then, filter out all empty strings
  - Then join them together.

  All in all, this is supposed to remove the dynamic elements of a heading so user's don't have to
